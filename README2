RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

- SELECT * FROM table;
- SELECT column1,column2 FROM table;
- SELECT column1 FROM table WHERE column2 = "text"
- SELECT DISTINCT column1 FROM customers;    // distict, individual, different

- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column2 < number;   // < , > , <= , >= , !=
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column2 BETWEEN number AND number;
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 LIKE '%...'        // '.../'
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column2 IN ('...','...')  

- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column1;
- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column2 DESC;      // ASC

- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column2="text" AND column1 < number; 
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column3="text" AND (column2 LIKE '%A' OR column2 LIKE 'A%');
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE  NOT column2="text" AND NOT column1="text";

- INSERT INTO table (column1,column2) VALUES ("...","...","...");

- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column3 IS NOT NULL;

- UPDATE table SET column1="..." WHERE column2 = number;     // without where all column will be updated
- DELETE table  WHERE column1 = number;      // without where all column will be deleted
- DELETE FROM  table;
- DELETE FROM column1;
- DROP TABLE table;

- SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1='...' LIMIT 3;
- SELECT MIN(column1) FROM table;
- SELECT MAX(column2) AS max_price FROM table WHERE price> number;
- SELECT COUNT(column1) AS number_record FROM table;  // SUM(), AVG()

**Wildcards:**
